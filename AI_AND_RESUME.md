# Why No AI Work on My Resume

I use AI tools daily—Claude, Gemini, GPT, aider, and various MCP configurations for codebase work. They are part of my workflow the same way an IDE or a calculator is.

I do not list this on my resume because I have not done AI work at the level I would expect from a principal engineer. Building a side project with extensive prompting is not the same as owning an AI system in production, making adoption decisions for an organization, or operating something with real reliability requirements.

The projects I have built with AI assistance—like [fossiq.github.io](https://fossiq.github.io), a KQL-to-DuckDB query tool—are useful, but the work was mostly prompting, not architecture. That is not the bar I hold myself to.

When I have AI work that reflects principal-level ownership—strategy, reliability, long-term operational responsibility—I will add it. Until then, it stays off.
