## About

12+ years building frontend platforms at scale. I create the infrastructure that lets hundreds of engineers ship fast and reliably.

**Current:** Technical owner for Developer Experience at DocuSign, impacting 440+ engineers.

**Past:** Microsoft Teams — led frontend architecture and platform modernization.

## What I Do

- **Micro-Frontend Architecture** — Module Federation, independent deployments
- **Monorepo Strategy** — Nx, distributed builds, remote caching
- **Legacy Modernization** — AngularJS to React migrations without breaking production
- **Developer Experience** — Build systems, local dev loops, tooling that developers love

## Highlights

- Led [1FE](https://github.com/docusign/1fe) — DocuSign's open-source micro-frontend framework
- Reduced local dev loop from minutes to under a minute at Teams Admin Center
- Built frontend platform standards consumed by 16+ production applications

## This Repo

This is a **minimal example** of a JSON Resume-based career profile.

```
/
├── careerProfile.json   # Resume data (JSON Resume schema)
├── README.md            # You're reading it
└── templates/           # Custom LaTeX/HTML templates (optional)
```

### Usage

1. Fork this repo
2. Edit `careerProfile.json` with your details
3. Add custom templates to `templates/` if needed
4. Use your preferred build tooling to generate PDF/HTML

The `careerProfile.json` follows the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) standard with optional extensions.
