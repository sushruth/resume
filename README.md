This repository contains the source for my resume in a structured, automated format. The latest PDF is available on the [**Releases**](https://github.com/sushruth/resume/releases) page.

### How It Works

The resume is stored as structured data following the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) standard (`resume.json`). I built [**Pause**](https://github.com/usually-frustrated/pause), a GitHub Action that generates PDF and HTML versions from this source. Pushing changes to `main` triggers a new release automatically.
