I'm a frontend engineer with 12+ years of experience, currently at DocuSign and previously at Microsoft. I specialize in **Frontend Platform Engineering** and **Developer Experience**—building the infrastructure and tooling that lets large engineering organizations ship reliably.

My work tends to focus on the problems that sit between "individual feature" and "organizational scale": monorepo architecture, micro-frontend platforms, CI/CD pipelines, and the kind of developer tooling that turns a painful local dev loop into something fast and predictable. At DocuSign, I've led initiatives impacting 440+ engineers. At Microsoft, I worked on Teams Admin Center and healthcare integrations.

I care about making things work well for other engineers. That often means building frameworks, writing internal tools, or modernizing legacy systems in ways that don't break production.
