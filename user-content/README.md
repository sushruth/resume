### Engineering Philosophy

In hardware engineering, **data integrity** and **process repeatability** are critical for closing the loop between simulation and measurement. I apply these same principles to my professional documentation.

This repository treats my career history as a **Single Source of Truth** (`careerProfile.json`), eliminating version skew and ensuring that every output—whether PDF or web—is generated from a validated dataset. It reflects my approach to engineering:

1.  **Structured Data:** Just as simulation models require clean inputs, this project enforces a strict schema for career data.
2.  **Automation:** Manual reporting is error-prone. This workflow automates the generation of LaTeX and HTML artifacts, similar to how I automate VNA data post-processing.
3.  **Traceability:** Every change is version-controlled, providing a clear history of professional growth.

### Technical Arsenal

| Domain         | Tools & Standards                                              |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simulation** | Ansys HFSS/SIwave, PowerSI, Hyperlynx, ADS, Simbeor            |
| **Interfaces** | PCIe Gen 5, USB4, LPDDR5x, MIPI, Ethernet, Thunderbolt 5       |
| **Lab**        | VNA (Vector Network Analysis), TDR, BERT, Oscilloscopes        |
| **Methods**    | Channel Modeling, Calibration/De-embedding, Compliance Testing |

### Repository Architecture
