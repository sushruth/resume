% Objective Statement
%====================

I'm a Senior Software Development Engineer (SDE) specializing in TypeScript, React, Webpack, and other browser/web view technologies. My expertise spans development tooling from local environments to deployment, as well as runtime innovations like Module Federation, state management strategies, and cross-project code sharing. In addition, I've experimented with various measurement and alerting techniques to optimize system performance. As a senior member of my team, I take on mentorship roles for junior engineers in UI/JS development. I'm also committed to contributing my experience and insights to team discussions around UI development paradigms, designs, and industry trends, helping drive innovation and best practices across the organization.
